# RFtools
Miscellaneous Tools For Random Forest Models
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Download

My recommendation is to install directly from github 

## INSTALLATION
make sure you have ```devtools``` installed and loaded, for windows also install ```Rtools```

In your R session

```install_github("pmartinezarbizu/RFtools")```

That's it
